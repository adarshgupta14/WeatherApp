# WeatherApp
I have created an weather app, using HTML, CSS and Js. It shows the weather as well as with other details like aqi, condition of the requested place.
User just have to provide input to the app of the place in which the user is interested about in the input box and click on Get Weather. Then the app will provide to the user back all details related to place, they are temperature, aqi, latitude, longitude, condition.
This WeatherApp is created using frontend details and with some API connections to get the weather of the places from the server.
